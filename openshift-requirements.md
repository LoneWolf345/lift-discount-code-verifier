## Additional Notes
Please provide any additional requirements or considerations specific to your OpenShift environment:

```
Notes:
1. Application is configured as a stateless Node.js application using Vite
2. Using multi-stage Docker build to minimize final image size
3. Non-root user configuration is implemented (UID 1001)
4. Health checks are configured in the Dockerfile
5. Application listens on port 8080 as required by OpenShift
```
